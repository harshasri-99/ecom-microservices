Ecommerce Application using Microservices

Designed a e-commerce application with different microservices : User, Product and Order Microservices.
Order-service interacts with User and Product microservice. Each microservice uses RESTful webservices
using Spring boot, worked with Spring JPA and H2 database, Swagger documantation, Exception handling, Validation, static and dynamic Filtering, monitoring using Actuator.
Extensively worked on Spring Cloud features for developing and accessing microservices -
Eureka as service registry, Feign client, spring config server for configuration management using git, Load balancer for dynamic scaling, API gateway and Fault tolerence circuit breaker using Resilience4j.
Used Docker to containerize microservices by building images and container which makes deployment ofmicroservices easy, docker-compose to ensure all microservices are up and running.
implemented additional features like Zipkin and RabbitMQ for asynchronous distributed tracing
